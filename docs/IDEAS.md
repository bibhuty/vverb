### Telemetry Environment Layer — 2025-07-29

**Summary:**  
Emit customizable telemetry from all DB adapters, controlled by a .env file.

**Context / Problem:**  
Most users don’t know what telemetry to enable; want to make it zero-config.

**Potential Impact:**  
Could make vverb the easiest lib to integrate into existing monitoring stacks.

**Status:**  
Parked for V2, revisit after core adapter APIs are stable.

**Summary:**  
A simple VS Code extension to display vector search results in tables.

Lower barrier to entry for new users; helpful for demos.

**Status:**  
Backlogged, revisit after CLI MVP.
