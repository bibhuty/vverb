# vverb ‚Äî Guiding Principles

Last updated: 2025-07-29

## 1. Core Values

- **Keep it Simple:** Design for clarity and obviousness. The ‚Äúdumber,‚Äù the better.
- **Minimum Surprise:** Favor predictable behavior, boring interfaces, and explicit docs.
- **Vendor-Agnostic:** Abstract the 80% common case, expose escape hatches for the rest.
- **Community First:** Encourage contributions, document everything, welcome feedback.
- **Iterate in the Open:** Be transparent about progress, mistakes, and roadmap.

## 2. What We Aim to Achieve

- **Unified Experience:** One codebase, five vector DBs, seamless switching.
- **Homogenize the Boring:** Standardize not just verbs but variable names and telemetry.
- **Escape Hatches:** Power users always have access to underlying SDKs.
- **First-Class Telemetry:** Make observability a default, not an afterthought.

---

## 3. Future Vision

- Become the "Hibernate" or "SQLAlchemy" for vector databases.
- Offer a full ‚Äúdeveloper joy‚Äù stack: core SDK, easy telemetry, minimal UI/CLI for rapid prototyping.
- If commercial: Monetize via optional micro-SaaS (telemetry, dashboard), but keep adapters open.

## 4. Sprint & Execution Principles

- **Work-Life Balance:** Respect contributors‚Äô time; avoid burnout.
- **Disciplined Sprints:** Work in 2-4 week increments. Freeze scope, park ideas, review after sprint.
- **‚ÄúIdeas are Parked, Not Lost‚Äù**: Anything not in-scope goes into `ideas/backlog.md` for future review.
- **Automate Everything:** Linting, tests, and CI are mandatory before every merge.
- **Celebrate Small Wins:** Any passing PR, contribution, or community feedback = success.

## 5. Review & Revision

This file should be reviewed at the start and end of every sprint for necessary updates.

## üõë Rules for Ditching an Idea

1. **Have you really tried everything?**  
   Before deciding to drop an idea or project, honestly ask yourself if you‚Äôve explored all reasonable options, iterations, and pivots.

2. **Don‚Äôt ditch too early.**  
   Don‚Äôt give up at the first sign of difficulty or boredom. Give the idea enough time and effort for a fair evaluation.

3. **Don‚Äôt ditch out of frustration alone.**  
   Temporary blocks, burnout, or impatience are not valid reasons to abandon something promising. Take a break or seek feedback before quitting.

4. **Ditch for a better reason, not a shiny new one.**  
   Only let go if another path clearly aligns better with your long-term vision or goals‚Äînot just because something else looks new or exciting.

5. **Document your decision.**  
   When you choose to ditch an idea, add a note in your `ideas.md` or here:
   - *What did you try?*
   - *Why did you decide to stop?*
   - *What might have changed your mind?*

6. **Be honest with yourself.**  
   This is for your own clarity‚Äîrecord the real reasons, not just what sounds good.
